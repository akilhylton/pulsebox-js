## ðŸ’­ Background

pulsebox is the data collector and storage solution for managing data between [pulsetracker](https://github.com/akilhylton/pulsetracker).

## Who is this app for?

This app allows developers to easily record and upload heart rate
data. It's a touch-based system where users will place one of their fingers on the back camera while the flash is present. The user will record a 10-second video that can then be uploaded to pulsebox for later processing by [pulsetracker](https://github.com/akilhylton/pulsetracker).

## Why Touch Based?

Touch-based systems are generally more accurate and efficient compared to Touch-less systems. A touch-based system requires physical input such as a finger on a camera however, a touch-less system usually uses the front camera without physical input.
